The kids take over and use their knowledge of the school to fend for themselves and make weapons,

Story: 

In the CompSci room, which has been baricaded off using the blow up couch from world's, Nathaniel and Makoto are 
working hard on defending themselves. 

Everyone was panicking. The kids knew they could not just stay in the Cafeteria with MSW, Charlie, and Gordie on 
the loose. They tiptoed past the sandwich bar and ran to the elevators. Liam, pizza in hand, repeatedly pushed the 
down button on the elevator panel, but Nicky quickly interjected.

"Are you serious? You want to take the elevator and take the chance of getting stuck in the elevator or trapped by
the zombies??" Nicky questioned.

The kids looked at each other and, while Liam finished off his pizza, they ran towards the staircase and down the steps
toward the lobby.

"Ahhh" screamed Eliana as she flew back up the stairs.

"What? Are you ok?" Jack asked, oblivious to the flood of zombies marching slowly up the stairs.

As the rest of the kids saw the zombies, they all screamed, except for Dillon and Makoto. They whipped around and took
the steps, two at a time, until they were so out of breath they could not continue. The kids found themselves on the
11th floor where they quickly tried to come up with a plan.
